# Picture Streamer

The application streams image previews from your DSLR or simular
camera to a web interface, allowing you to download pictures
the moment they've been taken.

This projects goal is to enable you to use your camera for
**Picture Broadcasting**, which is to publish professional grade photos
within less than 2 Minutes after they've been taken.

The camera connection is handled by [Gphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/).
All cameras supporting tethered shooting with your version of libgphoto2
should be supported by this software.

Please take a look at the users guide (Documentation/UsersGuide.pdf) for
further information.
